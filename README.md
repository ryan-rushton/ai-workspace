# ai-workspace

Collection of AI tools and scripts to sync between things.

Since each tool has its own environment, it is recommended to have separate activation script evs.

Git LFS wasn't working out of the box for me so I needed to run the following to set up on windows.

```
git config --global core.sshCommand "C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe"
```

## TODO

- Script to bootstrap all apps.
- Script to update all.
- Set up some kind of shared data directory so I can share input data such as training images and caption files.
